  "isbn": "9780553380163",
  "description": "An overview of cosmology and black holes.",
  "copies": 5,

Business Logic:

* Quantity must not exceed available copies
* Copies are auto-deducted
* If stock = 0, availability is updated to false

```json
Request:
{
  "book": "<bookObjectId>",
  "quantity": 2,
  "dueDate": "2025-07-18T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### 7. Borrow Summary (Aggregation)

`GET /api/borrow`

Response:

```json
[
  {
    "book": {
      "title": "The Theory of Everything",
      "isbn": "9780553380163"
    },
    "totalQuantity": 5
  }
]
```

##  Error Format

```json

  "message": "Validation failed",
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "name": "ValidationError",
    "errors": {
      "copies": {
        "message": "Copies must be a positive number",
        "name": "ValidatorError"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
